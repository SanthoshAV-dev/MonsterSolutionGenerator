# MonsterSolutionGenerator
This utility tool helps to create monster solution file and load huge number of projects (only .csproj) into it.

There are 2 options to create monster solution file.
As s first step,If you don't have an existing solution file, create a new one by providing the relevant name and path for it.
If already an existing solution file is there, then just provide its path.

Secondly, select the path which contains .csproj files which will be loaded into the solution file created.
Tool automatically picks only .csproj file and does not support any other format as of now.
